The Vitality Workouts action package provides endpoints for calculating performance metrics across various types of workouts, including running, cycling, walking, hiking, tennis, and core exercises. Each endpoint allows for the aggregation of performance data such as distance, duration, heart rate, heart rate recovery, and calories burned over specified time periods using different aggregation types like sum, average, max, min, and count. Additionally, there is an endpoint for retrieving detailed information about the most recent running workouts, focusing on key metrics to analyze workout intensity, duration, and performance trends.
