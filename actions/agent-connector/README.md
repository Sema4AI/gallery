In Sema4.ai Studio, let your agents talk to each other seamlessly.

## Overview

The Agent Connector allows agents within the Sema4.ai platform to communicate with each other through a simple and
intuitive interface. This connector provides actions to create communication conversations and send messages between agents,
facilitating smooth and efficient inter-agent communication.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to interact with agents is using the `ask_agent` function:

> Ask the Marketing Agent for a 10-word description of Studio

## Available Actions

**Primary Interface:**
- `ask_agent()` - The simplest way to ask an agent a question by name

**Agent Management:**
- Get all agents
- Get agent by name (with intelligent suggestions if not found)

**Conversation Management:**
- Get conversations for an agent
- Get a specific conversation
- Create a conversation
- Send a message to existing conversation

## Example Usage

### Simple Agent Interaction

```
Ask "Data Agent Example" to help me analyze my dataset
```

> The "Data Agent Example" responded: "I'd be happy to help you analyze your dataset! Could you please provide more details about the data you're working with?"
> 
> Conversation ID: `abc123-def456-ghi789` (use this to continue the conversation)

### Continue a Conversation

```
Ask "Data Agent Example" to explain the previous analysis further
```

> The "Data Agent Example" responded: "Based on our previous analysis, here's a more detailed explanation..."

### Get Available Agents

```
What agents do I have available?
```

> Here are the agents you currently have running:
> 1. Data Agent Example
> 2. The Ultimate Data Sources Test

### Intelligent Suggestions

If you mistype an agent name, the system will suggest the closest match:

```
Ask "Data Agnet" to help me
```

> Agent 'Data Agnet' not found. Did you mean 'Data Agent Example'?
> Available agents: Data Agent Example, The Ultimate Data Sources Test

## How It Works

### Simple Agent Communication

The `ask_agent` function provides the easiest way to interact with agents:

1. **Automatic Agent Resolution**: Just provide the agent name - the system will find the agent and handle any typos with intelligent suggestions
2. **Conversation Management**: Automatically creates new conversations when needed, or uses existing ones for follow-up messages
3. **Structured Responses**: Returns both the agent's response and conversation ID for easy continuation

### Advanced Usage

For more control, you can also use the individual actions:

1. **Agent Discovery**: Use `get_all_agents` to see available agents or `get_agent_by_name` for specific lookups with suggestions
2. **Conversation Management**: Create conversations manually or retrieve existing ones
3. **Message Sending**: Send messages to specific conversations with full control over the process

### Authentication

- **Cloud Environment**: Uses Bearer token authentication with your API key
- **Local Development**: Use "LOCAL" as the API key value (no authentication required)

### Intelligent Features

- **Name Suggestions**: If you mistype an agent name, the system suggests the closest match
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with available agent names when agents aren't found
- **Conversation Continuity**: Easy follow-up messages using returned conversation IDs

Let your agents talk to each other seamlessly!
