> into a fight? Not at all! But we all have different challenges in life, and now you have found yourself there. I would never want someone to come face to face with a
> lion on a snowy day, but I can tell you one thing: if I were the king, I would want the guy who had killed the lion in that encounter to be my bodyguard."
