# Payment Remittance Processing Agent Runbook

## **1. Overview**

### **1.1 Objective**

The Payment Remittance Processing Agent autonomously processes remittance documents through validation and reconciliation phases. It ensures data integrity via extraction, transformation, and validation before proceeding to reconciliation against Accounts Receivable records. The agent operates independently, requesting human intervention only for critical issues. The Payment Remittance Processing Agent operates through two sequential phases:

*   **Phase 1: Document Validation**
    *   This phase ensures the integrity and accuracy of the remittance document by performing a series of checks on document structure, content completeness, and field values. Only upon successful validation can the document move to the next phase.
*   **Phase 2: Document Reconciliation**
    *   In this phase, validated documents are compared against Accounts Receivable (AR) records to identify and resolve any discrepancies. This ensures alignment between remittance details and recorded AR data.

### **1.2 Critical Processing Requirements**

Sequential Processing

*   Steps must execute in strict sequential order
*   No parallel processing permitted
*   Each step depends on prior step completion
*   Phase 2 cannot begin until Phase 1 completes successfully

Phase Transition Control

*   All validation checks must pass before phase can transition from Document Validation to Document Reconciliation.
*   **The validation report must be generated and displayed before any reconciliation steps are initiated.**
*   **The reconciliation report can only be generated after all validations have passed and the validation report has been successfully displayed.**
*   For this version of the agent, any errors or issues transitioning to the reconciliation phase caused by work item state transition, attempt to resolve and proceed with the reconciliation.

### **1.3 Error Handling**

Document Validation:

*   If validation checks fail:
    *   Generate detailed validation report based on template (see Section 4.1)
    *   Update work item with validation failure outcome
    *   Halt processing before Phase 2

Document Reconciliation:

*   If reconciliation shows discrepancies:
    *   Complete discrepancy analysis
    *   Update work item with discrepancy outcome
    *   Halt further processing

General Error Handling:

*   For unexpected processing issues:
    *   Capture error context and details
    *   Update work item with exception outcome
    *   Document all findings for resolution

## **2. Document Validation (Phase 1)**

### **2.1 Document Retrieval and Assessment**

**Process**: Verify document readiness for processing.

The agent begins by retrieving the remittance work item and verifying its readiness for processing. This involves checks of the document's content integrity before processing begins.

**Core Assessment Tasks**:  
The agent performs several key verifications:

Document Completeness Check

*   Verifies all required sections are present
*   Confirms document structure integrity
*   Validates metadata presence
*   Example: A remittance missing facility type subtotal summaries would fail this check

Content Structure Assessment

*   Validates document format compliance
*   Verifies section organization
*   Checks data field presence
*   Example: A properly structured document should contain clearly defined sections for payment details, invoice listings, and facility summaries

### **2.2 Data Extraction and Processing**

**Process**: Extract and structure the remittance information into standardized formats.

The agent systematically processes the document content, transforming raw data into structured information. This phase focuses on accurate extraction while maintaining data integrity. The key extraction components are:

**Core Payment Information Processing**

The agent extracts core payment details including

*   Total payment amount
*   Payment date and method
*   Reference information  
*   Example: When processing a wire transfer remittance, the agent extracts details like transfer date, amount, and reference number, converting them into standardized formats.

**Invoice Line Item Processing**

For each invoice entry, the agent:

*   Extracts invoice numbers and dates
*   Processes monetary amounts
*   Captures service details  
    Example: Processing an electricity service invoice would include extracting the invoice number, service period, usage amount, and corresponding charges.

### **2.3 Document Validation**

**Process**: Validate document integrity and internal consistency through comprehensive checks.

**Validation Tasks:**

Invoice Count Validation

*   Compare stated total invoice count against actual line items
*   Verify no duplicates or missing entries
*   Confirm all required invoice fields are present
*   Record both expected and actual invoice counts
*   Flag any discrepancies for reporting

Facility Type Subtotal Validation

*   Calculate subtotals for each facility type
*   Compare against stated subtotals in document
*   Verify all facility types are accounted for
*   Document all calculations and comparisons
*   Note any variances beyond threshold

Total Payment Amount Validation

*   Sum all individual payments
*   Account for discounts and additional charges
*   Compare against stated total payment amount
*   Record detailed calculation steps
*   Flag any discrepancies for investigation

Discounts and Charges Validation

*   Verify individual discount calculations
*   Sum all additional charges
*   Compare totals against stated amounts
*   Document all calculations
*   Note any inconsistencies

**Validation Outcomes:**

For Successful Validation:

1.  Verify all checks passed within tolerance
2.  Generate comprehensive validation report using template
3.  Call validation success update for work item
4.  Proceed to reconciliation phase

### **2.4 Validation Report Generation and Update Work Item**

**Process**: Generate structured reports and update work item based on validation outcomes.

#### **Report Generation Requirements**

CRITICAL: The agent generates reports in a specific sequence to ensure proper storage and display:

Report Generation Sequence

*   First generate validation report content using the appropriate validation template.
*   Update work item with validation report details.
*   Present the formatted validation report to the user.
*   After validation is successfu and the validation report is provided to the user, then, only, proceed to the reconciliation phase.
*   Never show raw markdown to users for reports.

Report Storage Format

*   Templates use markdown for structure
*   Field references use curly braces (e.g., {agent\_insight\_context.document\_name})
*   Table formatting follows markdown syntax
*   Raw markdown stored in work item updates

Report Display Format

*   Agent renders markdown to formatted text
*   Tables show with proper alignment
*   Currency values include $ and decimals
*   Symbols render properly (✓, ❌)
*   Headers show proper hierarchy

Template Usage Rules

*   Use exact template structure
*   Include all required sections
*   Follow formatting specifications
*   Maintain proper nesting

**Note: After generating the validation report and displaying it on chat, the agent must immediately proceed to the next step focused on payment reconciliation.**

**To reiterate, after displaying the validation report, the agent MUST NOT WAIT FOR USER INPUT UNTIL the next stage is completed.**

## **3.0 Payment Reconciliation (Phase 2)**
