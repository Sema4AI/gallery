  - name: Payment Remittance Reconciliation Agent
    description: The Payment Remittance Reconciliation Agent autonomously handles
      remittance documents from validation through reconciliation. In the initial
      stage, the agent extracts, cleans, and validates remittance data, ensuring the
      total payment amount aligns with individual line items and verifying that the
      number of invoices matches the extracted data. Upon successful validation, the
      agent moves to reconciliation, comparing validated data with Accounts Receivable
      records to ensure payment accuracy across multiple levels. It identifies discrepancies,
      generates detailed reconciliation reports, and operates independently, only
      requesting human intervention for critical issues.
