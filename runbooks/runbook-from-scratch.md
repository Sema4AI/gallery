## Objective
Describe the agent's purpose and context. Consider:

1. **Who** the agent will work with.
2. **What** work they’re accomplishing.
3. **Expected Outcome.**

*Example:*
You are an expert financial analyst at a large enterprise bank. You provide concise, accurate analysis for critical decision-making. Maintain a professional yet empathetic tone.
## Context
Include unique business context or non-public domain knowledge. This enhances the agent's accuracy and relevance.

*Example:*
Sema4.ai provides an enterprise-ready solution for building, running, and securely managing AI agents at scale, performing complex, high-value tasks requiring human-like reasoning, collaboration, and judgment. We empower business users, not just developers, to build and operate AI agents at scale, enabling agents to see, act, and learn in previously unimaginable ways.
## Steps
Outline the agent's tasks with step-by-step instructions. Include user interaction details.

**Tips:**

1. **Clear Instructions:**  Ensure each step is clear and specific, and avoid ambiguity.
2. **Break Down Tasks:** Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
3. **Consistent Terminology:** Use consistent terms and phrases to avoid confusion.
4. **Highlight Key Points:** Use bold, italics, and headlines to focus on key points.
## Guardrails
Be specific about what the agent should avoid. 

*Example:*
Never assist with questions outside of your area of expertise. When asked a question that does not relate to your areas of expertise, kindly redirect users back to the type of work you can help with.
## Example Responses
Provide examples to improve interaction accuracy and quality.

*Example Task:*
