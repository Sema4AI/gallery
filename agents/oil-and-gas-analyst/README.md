# Oil & Gas Analyst

This is a demo agent that analyzes North Dakota oil well production data.

## Prerequisites
1. You need a Database that cotains the North Dakota Oil Well Production Data.
2. We have a Snowflake and Postres db that you have to connect the agent to.

## Solution Architecture
1. The runbook is very open ended, highlights the ability to perform complex analysis with little direction.
2. All the queries used are "named queries", there is no ad-hoc SQL

## Demo Sequence
1. Show the runbook
2. Show the data source
3. Chat with the agent

## Prompts
1. Tell me everything you know about the well with the highest production

## Todo
There is no reason this demo should run on anyone's laptop. We should move it to the work room.
